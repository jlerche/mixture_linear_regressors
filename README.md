This is a simple example of how to apply the expectation-maximization algorithm to data that appears to exhibit two linear trends. This method provides a robust way of determining the regression parameters for each trend as well as a quantitative criterion for determining whether multiple trends exist, or whether it's simply an artifact of the data. The current implementation is using Numpy/Scipy, but I will add a Tensorflow implementation.
